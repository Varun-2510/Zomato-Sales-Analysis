# Zomato-Sales-Analysis
I spearheaded a comprehensive Zomato analysis project using Power BI, encompassing sales dashboard creation, user performance assessment, and city performance analysis.
Leveraging Kaggle data, I conducted ETL operations and harnessed Power BI's DAX functions for data management and manipulation.

## About The Project

I have developed a comprehensive Zomato analysis project utilizing Power BI. The project includes three main components: a sales dashboard, user performance analysis, and city performance analysis.

### Sales Dashboard: 
This dashboard provides an overview of Zomato's sales data, showcasing key metrics such as total revenue, orders, average order value, etc.

### User Performance Analysis: 
This analysis focuses on understanding user behaviour on the Zomato platform. By leveraging the data collected from Kaggle,
I calculated various user performance metrics such as frequency of orders, the average rating given by users, user retention rates, etc.

### City Performance Analysis: 
This component delves into the performance of different cities in terms of Zomato usage, 
Power BI's DAX functions were utilized to derive meaningful metrics such as the number of restaurants per capita, average delivery time, popular cuisines in each city, etc.
